# In-Console Gambling Machine

This application simulates a slot machine by randomly creating values of
1, J, Q, K, or A at differing rates. Uses console new line procedures to 
emulate the actual roll of a slot machine. Calculated rate of return is currently
about 95%. Uses randomly generated numbers, seeded at current time with each fresh compile.
