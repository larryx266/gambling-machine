# In-Console Gambling Machine

This application simulates a slot machine by randomly creating values of
1, J, Q, K, or A at differing rates. Uses console new line procedures to 
emulate the actual roll of a slot machine. Calculated rate of return is currently
about 95%. Uses randomly generated numbers, seeded at current time with each fresh compile.

gambaMachine is the gambling machine class which creates the slot machine, and gamba.cpp
has the main() function that creates the user interface.
